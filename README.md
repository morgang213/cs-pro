- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Web application security testing including XSS, SQL injection, and SSL/TLS analysis
- **IP Analysis**: Geolocation, reputation checking, and threat intelligence

### üîê Security Analysis
- **Password Analyzer**: Comprehensive password strength assessment with entropy calculation
- **Hash Generator/Verifier**: Cryptographic hash operations supporting multiple algorithms
- **Email Security**: Email address analysis and content scanning for phishing/spam detection

### üåç Domain Intelligence
- **WHOIS Analysis**: Domain registration information and DNS record investigation
- **DNS Security**: SPF, DMARC, and security configuration analysis
- **Domain Reputation**: Risk assessment and suspicious pattern detection

### üìä Monitoring & Reporting
- **Security Log Analysis**: Multi-format log parsing and threat detection
- **Report Generator**: Comprehensive security reports in multiple formats
- **Dashboard**: Real-time security monitoring and analysis overview

## Installation

The application runs on Replit with all dependencies automatically managed:

```bash
# Dependencies are automatically installed via uv
# Core packages: streamlit, pandas, plotly, requests
# Security packages: cryptography, bcrypt, scapy, python-whois, dnspython, shodan, python-nmap
```

## Usage

1. **Start the Application**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py --server.port 5000
   ```

2. **Access the Dashboard**
   - Navigate to the provided URL (typically http://localhost:5000)
   - Select tools from the sidebar navigation

3. **Tool-Specific Usage**
   - **Network Scanner**: Enter target IP/hostname and select scan type
   - **Vulnerability Assessment**: Input target URL and choose assessment type
   - **Password Analyzer**: Enter password for strength evaluation
   - **Hash Utils**: Generate or verify cryptographic hashes
   - **IP Analysis**: Analyze IP addresses for geolocation and reputation
   - **Domain Analysis**: Investigate domains with WHOIS and DNS analysis
   - **Email Security**: Check email addresses and content for threats
   - **Log Analysis**: Upload security logs for threat detection
   - **Report Generator**: Create comprehensive security assessment reports

## Security Features

### Network Analysis
- Port scanning with service identification
- Concurrent scanning for improved performance
- Host discovery and OS detection
- SSL/TLS configuration analysis

### Threat Detection
- Phishing email detection

## External API Integration

The tool supports optional integration with external threat intelligence services:

- **IPInfo**: IP geolocation services (requires IPINFO_TOKEN)
- **VirusTotal**: Malware and threat intelligence (requires VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY)
- **AbuseIPDB**: IP reputation checking (requires ABUSEIPDB_API_KEY)

Set these as environment variables to enable enhanced features.

## Architecture

### Frontend
- **Streamlit**: Interactive web application framework
- **Plotly**: Data visualization and charting
- **Responsive Design**: Wide layout with expandable sidebar

### Backend
- **Modular Design**: Separate utility classes for each analysis type
- **Concurrent Processing**: Multi-threaded operations for improved performance
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with user-friendly messages

### Security Considerations
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting for network operations
- Secure API key handling via environment variables
- SSL certificate verification options
